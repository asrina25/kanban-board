# Kanban Task Manager

A simple **drag-and-drop Kanban board** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
You can add tasks, move them between **To Do**, **Doing**, and **Done** lanes,  
and all tasks (including their positions) are saved using **localStorage**, so they stay even after refreshing the page.

---

## Features
- **Add new tasks** to the To Do lane
- **Drag and drop** tasks between lanes
- **Persistent storage** (tasks stay in their lanes after refreshing)
- **Responsive layout** for better usability
- **No external libraries** – pure HTML, CSS, and JS
